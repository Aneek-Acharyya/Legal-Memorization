Regarding the variation in the area as pointed out by the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, the matter was discussed in the joint inspection on 21.02.2024 and it was found that the variation was due to the wrong conversion factor by the Punjab Revenue authorities. The mutation of the land has been attested in favour of `Makbooja Mehkama Timber Market' on 12.02.1990 vide award number 132/H on 19.10.1954 to the extent of 351 Kanals 10 Marlas, which when converted in acres, comes out to be 33.31 acres.

Due to the carelessness of revenue staff, the entire record of rights/land like Lattha, Musavi, field book and khasra girdawri is missing/untraceable from 2004 due to which he and the proprietors of the village are facing problem in identification of their property and other land ownership related issues. He filled CWP no. 16320 of 2018 on which the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana ordered reconstruction of the revenue record.	FAC
However till M.A No. 114/2023 Sanjeev Kumar Vs. DC, Rupnagar & Ors . In O.A. No. 882/2022 26 today complete revenue record has not been reconstructed and writ petition is still pending in the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana.	FAC
During the pendency of the writ petition Counsel for the State of Punjab made a statement before the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana that land record regarding his ownership has been reconstructed and his land will be demarcated in case application is made in this regard. Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana vide order dated 17.07.2019 granted liberty to him to move fresh application for demarcation with direction to the State of Punjab to demarcate as per fresh re-constructed revenue record.

Himachal Pradesh Forest Department has filled suit in the Civil Court Nangal qua land in dispute which is still pending adjudication.	FAC
As such till the decision of the Civil Court, the directions given by this Tribunal be kept in abeyance as the same may amount to contradictory outcomes. Respondent no. 3-Daljit Singh has denied ownership of Himachal Pradesh Forest Department and claimed that the popular and other trees were planted by his father and other proprietors of the village in their own land for their personal use and the Himachal and the Punjab Governments have any authority to restrict him and other proprietors from using the timber in the manner they want. 25. Strangely enough, copies of the writ petition and civil suit have not been filed by the Deputy Commissioner, Rupnagar or respondent no. 3- Daljit Singh and details of the patti land namely "Taraf Sardara Hasab Hissa Jaddi" claimed by respondent no. 3-Daljit Singh have not been given and copies of the reconstructed revenue record pertaining to the same have not been produced.
