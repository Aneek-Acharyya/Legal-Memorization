The authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above. The Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 17/05/2024 at 21:33:22 New Delhi.	FAC
The Complainant, astutely aware of the encumbrances shrouding the property's title, chose to initiate negotiations with the applicant, as a result of which the applicant agreed to buy the property and several legal documents such as Agreement to Sell, Affidavit, GPA, SPA, etc were executed on 10.05.2021. The consideration for transfer of the said property was transfer of applicant's ancestral property situated in Bihar, in favour of the Complainant.	FAC
However, later the applicant learnt that the property had encumbrances in the form of charges emanating from Yes Bank as well as arbitration proceedings. Insolvency proceedings were initiated against the Complainant due to which an interim moratorium was operating.	FAC
Complainant mischievously kept on delaying the execution of the Sale Deed and left with no option, applicant filed a civil suit being CS(OS) 122/2022, before this Court seeking execution of the Sale Deed. Complainant cleverly persuaded the applicant to execute a Memorandum of Understanding on 03.03.2022 and as a goodwill gesture applicant cleared a substantial amount outstanding towards the electricity bill.	ARG
Later the applicant filed a second suit for specific performance being CS(OS) 161/2022, wherein the Complainant made an unequivocal declaration that he had sold the property to the applicant and received the sale consideration amounting to 38.50 Crores. On this score, applicant sought to withdraw the suit by filing an application under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC , which was not permitted by the Court but finally the applicant, Complainant and M/s Apogee Manufacturing Pvt.	FAC
Ltd. settled the matter amicably and a Settlement Agreement was executed on 03.07.2022. Despite being party to all these litigations, Complainant chose to file a false and frivolous complaint against the applicant resulting in registration of the present FIR.

The authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above. The Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 17/05/2024 at 21:33:22 6. It is argued that the allegations against the applicant are false and frivolous and against Complainant's own stand in various litigations that he had sold the property in question to the applicant for consideration.	ARG
In any case, the investigation is complete and charge-sheet and supplementary charge-sheet have been filed. All necessary documents pertaining to the applicant have been seized by the investigating agency and custody of the applicant is no longer required.	FAC
It is evident that the disputes between the applicant and the Complainant are purely civil in nature and have been given the colour of criminal liability only to extort money from the applicant. It is further argued that mere pendency of other FIRs against the applicant cannot be a ground to deny bail in the present case as per the settled law of the land.	ARG
In any case, the applicant is on bail in three FIRs being GR No. 308/2023, 396/2023 and 514/2023. 7. Learned APP for the State, per contra, relying on the Status Report argues that Complainant came in contact with the applicant while he was in custody in 2016 on the basis of false cases filed by one Nikhil Nanda. After the Complainant was granted bail in February 2022, applicant came to his residence and represented himself as Tantrik/Astrologer/Self-Styled Guruji and assured the Complainant that he had good relationships with people in Judiciary and the Government and would be able to manage all his pending litigations.	ARG
Applicant convinced the Complainant that if he wanted to save his property and the Company, Joint Investment Pvt. Ltd. (JIPL), he would have to give a statement in Court in CS(OS) 161/2022 that he had sold his property to the applicant, which is what the Complainant did, albeit, no amount was ever paid by the applicant, which he now admits.	FAC
Using the digital signature of the Complainant, the applicant transferred the shares of BAIL APPLN. 3511/2023 Page 10 of 14 This is a digitally signed order. The authenticity of the order can be re-verified from Delhi High Court Order Portal by scanning the QR code shown above.	FAC
The Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 17/05/2024 at 21:33:22 JIPL in his own name and also changed the Directors. Complainant was having serious medical issues and the applicant taking advantage of this fact gave him medicines without prescription and under the influence of medicines, applicant got various blank papers and cheques signed from the Complainant. 8. Ms. Richa Dhawan further submits that the allegations against the applicant are of cheating and forgery and are serious. The mobile phone recovered from the applicant has revealed his involvement in the crime, which are not being disclosed in the Status Report for the sake of confidentiality.	ARG
Cheque-book issued in favour of JIPL and keys of the Friends Colony property have also been recovered from his possession. At the instance of the applicant, co-accused T.V. Radhakrishanan has been arrested.	FAC
From the WhatsApp chats exchanged between the applicant and co-accused Majid Ali, incriminating evidence has come on record. It was also found that total 8200 shares were transferred by the applicant using digital signatures of the Complainant and the latter was made to submit online resignation in the company namely, Hari Raj Investment.	FAC
Applicant also changed the Directorship of Vijay Kumar Sinha. He has not only cheated the Complainant but has also filed forged and fabricated documents in the Court in various litigations.	ARG
Several FIRs have been registered against the Applicant for similar offences and he is the mastermind of a huge multi-victim scam. It is strenuously urged that while considering an application for bail the Court has to consider the gravity of the offence; criminal antecedents of the accused; likelihood of the accused committing further offences; and/or likelihood of the accused absconding or evading the process of law as well as the nature of evidence on record against the BAIL APPLN. 3511/2023 Page 11 of 14 This is a digitally signed order.

The Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 17/05/2024 at 21:33:22 accused and the case of the present applicant for grant of bail fails on all the parameters. 9. Heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned APP for the State. 10. The allegations levelled against the applicant are serious and grave.	ARG
This Court is conscious of the fact that at the stage of grant of bail it must not enter into the realm of evidence, as that is the domain of the Trial Court. However, it is equally settled that there ought to be a prima facie satisfaction of the Court in support of the charge. [Ref: Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudarshan Singh , (2002) 3 SCC 598] 11. The genesis of the present FIR is the alleged fraudulent transfer of the property of the complainant at the Friends Colony through execution of forged and fabricated documents and without any consideration.

Applicant is alleged to have made the complainant sign on several blank documents taking advantage of his old age and ill-health and under influence of wrong medication. As per the Status Report, investigation has revealed that applicant transferred 8200 shares of JIPL in his name using digital signatures and other confidential information, he had access to and appointed himself as a Director.	FAC
Bank statements of the account of complainant revealed that no payment was transferred by the applicant to the complainant in lieu of the transfer of shares of JIPL as well as sale of the property. A false statement was made before the Court that complainant had sold the property for a sum of Rs.38.5 crores, whereas no payment was received and in fact today the applicant takes a different stand that the property was sold in consideration of transfer of his ancestral property in Bihar in favour of the complainant. As per the Status Report, several blank signed papers, affidavits and vakalatnama have been used to carry out BAIL APPLN. 3511/2023 Page 12 of 14 This is a digitally signed order.	FAC

Copies of multiple Aadhar Cards were found in his mobile phone. As per the prosecution, there is overwhelming incriminating evidence against the applicant at this stage connecting him to the crime and the WhatsApp chats between him and co-accused Mazid Ali recovered from the phone of the applicant establish a deep-rooted conspiracy.	ARG
WhatsApp conversations between applicant and co-accused T.V. Radhakrishanan point to plans of search of the 'safe' and the house of the complainant. The mobile phone of the complainant and the original share certificates are yet to be recovered.	FAC
Co-accused Dharmendra is absconding and as per the prosecution, there is a possibility that he might possess phones or other vital documents relating to the complainant and his companies. In this background prosecution requires the custody of the applicant to unearth the entire conspiracy and recover the crucial documents. 12. Parameters for considering an application for grant of bail are no longer res integra.	ARG
In Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee and Another , (2010) 14 SCC 496, while cancelling the bail granted by the High Court, the Supreme Court observed that amongst other circumstances, the factors to be borne in mind while considering an application for bail are: (a) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused has committed the offence; (b) nature and gravity of the accusation; (c) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction; (d) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing, if granted bail; (e) character, behaviour, position and standing of the accused; (f) danger of justice being thwarted by grant of bail; and (g) likelihood of the offence being repeated.

The Order is downloaded from the DHC Server on 17/05/2024 at 21:33:22 13. Keeping these principles in mind and seeing holistically, in my view, applicant cannot be enlarged on bail at this stage. This Court is fortified in its view by an order of a co-ordinate bench of this Court in Ajit v. State , 2024 SCC OnLine Del 1285. The allegations are serious and looking at the criminal antecedents of the applicant, with as many as 11 cases registered against him and all involving cheating, there is a propensity to commit crime repeatedly.	Ratio
The case before the Trial Court is at a nascent stage and charges are yet to be framed. Prosecution has taken a categorical stand that crucial documents such as the share certificates, mobile phones, details of digital signatures, etc. are yet to be recovered. FSL Report is awaited.	FAC
Applicant has made changes in shareholding of several companies and there are chances of his tampering with evidence and fleeing from justice. 14. Application is accordingly dismissed. 15. It is, however, made clear that nothing expressed in this order shall be construed as an expression of opinion on the merits of the case. CRL.M.A. 4317/2024 (by Applicant D. Lohrii, for impleadment as Respondent) 16. This application is disposed of with liberty to the applicant to take recourse to appropriate remedies in law.
