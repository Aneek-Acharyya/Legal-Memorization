Learned APP waives service of notice of Rule for and on behalf of respondent No.1 - State of Gujarat and learned advocate Mr. Y.V. Vaghela waives service of notice of Rule for and on behalf of respondent No.2 - original complainant. With the consent of learned advocates appearing for respective parties, present petition is taken up for final hearing. [2.0] By way of present application under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short " CrPC "), the petitioners have prayed to quash and set aside the impugned FIR being CR No.11191003210169 of 2021 registered with Khokhra Police Station, Ahmedabad City for the offences punishable under Sections 304 , 308 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 Page 1 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined (for short " IPC ") alongwith all consequential proceedings thereto. [3.0] Heard learned advocates appearing for the respective parties. [4.0] Learned advocate for the petitioners has submitted that the present petitioners are falsely enroped in the offence and they have not committed any offence as alleged.	ARG
The alleged complaint is filed at the instance of respondent No.2 wherein it is alleged that his son Tanishk aged 16 years was studying in 10 th Std. in Anand Niketan School and that complainant and his friend Rajendra Hastimal Khicha enrolled their sons viz. Tanishk and Sanyam respectively at Neha Coaching Centre, Khokhra run by present petitioner No.2 - accused No.3 and petitioner No.2 informed the complainant and his friend to hire auto rickshaw of petitioner No.1 (father of petitioner No.2) to which the complainant and his friend agreed and it was decided that petitioner No.1 would pick up and drop sons of complainant and his friend to and fro Neha Coaching Classes at a monthly charges of Rs.800/-.	FAC
At that time an assurance was given by petitioner No.1 that he would allow only three students in his auto-rickshaw but petitioner No.1 - accused No.2 used to board six students / passengers in his auto-rickshaw and to avoid detention of his rickshaw and/or any other proceedings under the Traffic Rules, petitioner No.1 used to ask the students to get down the rickshaw and cross the railway line near Dakshini under-bridge and after the students cross the railway track, he would again pick up the students and it was a routine practice of petitioner No.1. On 26.01.2021, accused No.1 Sonikaka was driving the auto- rickhaw and at that time the daughter of complainant received a Page 2 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined call from petitioner No.1 that when Tanishk and Sanyam were crossing the railway line at Dakshini under-bridge, they dashed with the train and sustained injuries and due to such accident, Tanishk succumbed to death while Sanyam has sustained grievous hurt.	FAC
It is alleged that petitioner No.1 used to daily ask the students to follow such practice so as to avoid any traffic memo or detention of his auto-rickshaw under the traffic rules because of which unfortunate incident has taken place. In this regard, complaint is filed. [5.0] Learned APP has vehemently opposed the present application and submitted that the petitioners have committed serious offence and therefore, has requested to dismiss the present petition. [6.0] I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments canvassed by learned advocate for the respective parties. [7.0] A bare perusal of the impugned FIR reveals that on the fateful day, petitioner No.1 was not present and he was not driving the auto-rickshaw.	ARG
So far as present petitioner No.2 is concerned, he is only the owner of coaching class and hence, there is no direct nexus or any intention on the part of the present petitioners to commit the alleged offence. Considering role attributed to the present petitioners, there is no any nexus between the students crossing the railway line and the act of the present petitioners on the fateful day.	ARG
Even if the allegations leveled against the present petitioners that the petitioner No.1 used to make sit more students and compel them to get down and cross the railway line near Dakshini under-bridge so as to Page 3 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined avoid detention of his vehicle and then make the students to again sit in the rickshaw are accepted as it is, even then same is not a ground to enrope the present petitioners in the alleged offence. There was an option on the part of the guardian of students to discontinue such practice or auto-rickshaw or even otherwise students had a liberty to refuse to do so.	ARG
It was the duty or headache on the part of the auto-rickshaw driver and not the students. Nonetheless, the petitioners were not present on the fateful day of the incident and driver of auto-rickshaw was one Sonikaka.	FAC
Hence, for the act of auto-rickshaw driver, the petitioners herein cannot be held vicariously liable or guilty for the said act. To attract the offence punishable under Section 304 of the IPC, following essential ingredients are material. [7.1] An offence under Section 304 provides punishment to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.	STA
Culpable homicide not amounting to murder has been made punishable in the following cases: (1) If the act by which death is caused is done with intention of causing death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment is imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and fine. (2) If the act is done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment is imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both. Page 4 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined Herein, no any act is done with intention on the part of the present petitioners causing death or bodily injury or which is likely to cause death and hence, said ingredient is lacking in the present case. [7.2] So far as offence punishable under Section 308 of the IPC is concerned, to attract the said provision, the prosecution has to establish the following ingredients: (i) That an act was committed by the accused; (ii) That the said act was done with the intention or knowledge that he shall be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and (iii) That culpable homicide does not amount to murder, (a) if the act is done with the intention or knowledge referred to in Section 300 IPC, but under circumstances which would bring the case within one of the exceptions mentioned in that section, or (b) if the act is done with the intention or knowledge referred to in Section 299 but not falling under clauses (2), (3) and (4) of Section 300 IPC. Thus, the act must be committed by the accused and the act ought to have been done with the intention or knowledge that if the said act is done with knowledge or intention then the same would amount to culpable homicide.	STA
In absence of any intention or knowledge, which is referred to in Section 300 of the Page 5 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined IPC , no offence under Section 304 or 308 of the IPC is made out. In the case on hand, no any intention or knowledge on the part of the present petitioners inasmuch as neither petitioner No.1 nor petitioner No.2 were driving the auto-rickshaw on the fateful day of the incident and hence, there is no direct nexus between any act or knowledge or intention on the part of the present petitioners in commission of the offence. [8.0] In view of the above, this Court is of the considered opinion that no offence under Section 304 of the IPC is made out.	RPC
In this regard, reference is required to be made to the decision in the case of Jayprakash vs. State (Delhi Admn.) reported in (1991) 2 SCC 32 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has vividly and extensively discussed the intention and knowledge as follows: "We may note at this stage that `intention' is different from `motive' or `ignorance' or `negligence'. It is the `knowledge' or `intention' with which the act is done that makes difference, in arriving at a conclusion whether the offence is culpable homicide or murder.	PRE
Therefore, it is necessary to know the meaning of these expressions as used in these provisions. The `intention' and `knowledge' of the accused are subjective and invisible state of mind and their existence has to be gathered from the circumstances, such as the, weapon used, the ferocity of attack, multiplicity of injuries and all other surrounding circumstances.	PRE
The framers of the code designedly used the words `intention' and `knowledge' and it is accepted that the knowledge of the consequences which may result in doing an act is not the samething as the intention that such consequences should ensue. Firstly, when an act is done by a person, it is presumed that he, must have been aware that certain specified harmful consequences would or could follow.	PRE
But that knowledge is bare awareness and not the same thing as intention that such Page 6 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined consequences should ensue. As compared to `knowledge', `intention' requires something more than the mere foresight of the consequences, namely the purposeful doing of a thing to achieve a particular end." [8.1] In absence of any intention or knowledge to cause death or bodily injury, no offence of culpable homicide punishable under Section 304 of the IPC is made out.	PRE
Merely an act to make sit more than three passengers or in excessive capacity in the auto- rickshaw is not a ground to prosecute the present petitioners for the offence punishable under Sections 304 and 308 of the IPC. It may be negligence on the part of the petitioners but this is not a case wherein direct involvement of the petitioners is made out. [8.2] Further, definitions of diverse offences under the Indian Penal Code state with precision that a particular act or omission to be an offence must be done maliciously, dishonestly, fraudulently, intentionally, negligently or knowingly. Certain other statutes prohibit acts and penalise contravention of the provisions without expressly stating that the contravention roust be with a prescribed state of mind.	Ratio
But an intention to offend the penal provisions of a statute is normally implicit, however, comprehensive or unqualified the language of the statute may appear to be, unless an intention to the contrary is expressed or clearly implied, for the general rule is that a crime is not committed unless the contravenor has mens rea. Normally full definition of every crime predicates a proposition expressly or by implication as to a state of mind: if the mental element of any conduct alleged to be a crime is absent in any given case, the crime so defined is not committed.	Ratio
In this regard, it would be appropriate to refer to the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Page 7 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined Court in the case of Nathulal vs. State Of Madhya Pradesh reported in AIR 1966 SC 43. Herein, in the case on hand, no element of mens rea or an abetment of alleged act is satisfied. [9.0] It is necessary to consider whether the power conferred by the High Court under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is warranted. It is true that the powers under Section 482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great caution in its exercise.	PRE
The Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution.	PRE
The High Court being the highest court of a State should normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case where the entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has not been collected and produced before the Court and the issues involved, whether factual or legal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true perspective without sufficient material. Of course, no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down in regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage as the Hon'ble Supreme Court has decided in the case of Central Bureau of Investigation vs. Ravi Shankar Srivastava, IAS & Anr. , reported in AIR 2006 SC 2872 and in case of State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal , reported in 1992 Supp (1) SCC 335, the Apex Court has set out the categories of cases in which the inherent power under Section 482 CrPC can be exercised and held in para 102 as under: Page 8 of 9 Downloaded on : Wed Aug 07 21:16:36 IST 2024 NEUTRAL CITATION R/CR.MA/9661/2021 ORDER DATED: 06/08/2024 undefined "(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. (6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party. (7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge." [10.0] In the result, the petition is allowed.	PRE
The impugned complaint being CR No.11191003210169 of 2021 registered with Khokhra Police Station, Ahmedabad City as well as all consequential proceedings initiated in pursuance thereof are hereby quashed and set aside qua the petitioners herein. Rule is made absolute accordingly.	PRE
