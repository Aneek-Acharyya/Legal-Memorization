Property no. 6/23, Old Double Storey, Lajpat Nagar IV, New Delhi was initially allotted to Sh.	FAC
Ranbir Oberoi vide lease deed dated 06.08.1961. Ranbir Oberoi applied for allotment of additional land and he was permitted to convert the common lavatory block for his exclusive use on an area measuring 188 sq. feet on the rear set back shared 50:50 to ground floor and first floor vide supplementary lease dated 06.11.1990.	FAC
Ranbir Oberoi expired on 22.05.2003 and the property in question stands substituted in the name of Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi vide letter dated 24.12.2010. Since then Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi, aged around Page 29 of 60 70 years has started filing RTI applications on the issues related to above property as well as on other related issues. 2. Now Shri P.K.	FAC
Oberoi has become habitual in seeking information on various property related issues such as mutation, substitution conversion by filing different type of RTI applications and also on the issues related to postings and transfer of the officials in L&DO and functioning of the office. To quote a sample- During the period 2020-2022, a total of 59 RTI applications, 27 appeals with First Appellate Authority and 2 appeals with Second Appellate Authority (CIC) have been filed by Shri P.K.	FAC
Oberoi under RTI Act, 2005 . 3. It is noticed that Shri P.K. Oberoi seeks some information on any of his RTI application and based on the response received files different RTI applications seeking other related information from the same CPIO or other CPIOs of this Office.	FAC
Most of the time he is not satisfied with the replies and hence files appeal with the First Appellate Authority. Repeated filing of RTI applications and appeals on the similar issues over the last 2-3 years which were responded by the CPIO, defeated the purpose of the RTI Act .	ARG
Moreover dealing with his repeated RTI applications has a continuous harassing effect on the public authority. Further, it is also observed that Shri P.K.	ARG
Oberoi has a tendency of complaining about the officials of this office when he is not satisfied with the response he wanted on his RTI applications. Shri P.K.	FAC
Oberoi also visits this office on every Wednesday (Public Hearing day) and meets officials, asks numerous questions and also enquires about his RTI applications. Further, based on the information he gathers during his visit, he files complaints against the officials.	FAC
There are several instances when Shri P.K Oberoi argues with the officers and demands to show official files and provide information on the spot. Thus he is not only wasting precious time of the Officials but also causing trouble for other visitors. 4. The Officers of this office were compelled to spend most of the time in answering repeated questions on the same subject matter asked from different angles; and about individual officers who, Shri P.K.	ARG
Oberoi thinks, are responsible for his grievances. It is also observed that Shri P.K.	ARG
Oberoi has filed RTI applications asking previous posting details of the officers of this Office, which do not have any larger public interest. 5. Further, the First Appellate Authority has given opportunity of personal hearing to Shri P.K. Oberoi atleast four times during the last one Page 30 of 60 year.	FAC
However, Shri P.K. Oberoi is never satisfied and has not stopped filing repeated RTI applications/appeals. 6. In this regard, the Central Vigilance Commission vide Circular dated 10.03.2017 has stated that the CIC's decision dated 25.06.2014 in the case of Shri Ramesh Chand Jain Vs DTC, GNCTD may be kept in view while processing RTI applications seeking information through repetitive RTI applications on similar issues/subjects: L.	PRE
No scope of repeating under RTI Act ii. Citizen has no Right to Repeat iii.	RPC
Repetition shall be ground of refusal iv. Appeals can be rejected 7. Decisions/observations of CIC in some similar cases are as under: i. In the case of Shri Gopal Soni v The New India Assurance Company Ltd (dated 12.6.2008) the Commission observed that: "answering the elaborate and detailed queries, which have to be both accurate and authentic, imposes heavy cost on the public authority and tends to divert its resources, which brings it within the scope of section 7(9) of RTI Act." ii.	PRE
In the case of Shri Dinesh Kumar Kesarwani v. PIO, Allahabad Museum , on 24.04.2017, CIC has observed that: a. The citizen has no right to repeat the same or similar or slightly altered information request under RTI Act, 2005 , for which he already got a response. b.	RLC
Once an RTI application is answered, the appellants shall refrain themselves from filing another RTI application against the public authority. c. Repetition shall be ground of refusal d.	RPC
An applicant or appellant repeating the RTI application or appeal either once or multiple times, suppressing the fact of earlier application and receipt of the answer, the CPIO of public authority may reject it forthwith after intimating it along with reasons, appeals can be rejected. e. The First Appellate Authority and Commission may be right and reasonable to consider this as a ground for rejecting the first or second appeal, respectively among other reasons if any. 8. The universal principle of civil justice also recognized 'constructive res- judicata, which in the RTI context means when an applicant uses an opportunity of obtaining information on a particular subject as per law, he is expected to seek all the related information in that first ever opportunity itself.	Ratio
He cannot file another application for a bit or piece Page 31 of 60 which he forgot to ask, or not advised by his lawyer, or for any other reason. He should ask all possible aspects of information about that subject matter, in the first ever available opportunity.	Ratio
Even if he does not, it is presumed by law that he asked for that and was refused after due trial. This is incorporated in principles of civil procedural justice and practiced universally.	Ratio
It is in the public interest and also to further the objectives of Right to Information Act , that such repeated or unending stream of questions being sought from same or different public authorities be stopped. 9.

FAC
Ranbir Oberoi vide lease deed dated 06.08.1961.

FAC
Ranbir Oberoi expired on 22.05.2003 and the property in question stands substituted in the name of Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi vide letter dated 24.12.2010. Since then Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi, aged around 70 years has started filing RTI applications on the issues related to above property as well as on other related issues. 3. It is humbly submitted that the RTI Act 2005 is to obtain information related to an individual or to some extent where larger public interest is involved.	FAC
However sometimes a few persons misuse this Act. It is observed that Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi has become habitual in seeking information on various issues like mutation, substitution conversion by filling different types of RTI applications and also on the issues related to posting and transfer of the officials in L&DO and functioning of the office and also many other issues/ procedure/ cases of this office which are not directly related to him. 4 Keeping in view of the above facts and directions of Central Vigilance Commission and decisions of Central Information Commission on repeated/ similar RTI application, it has been decided to reject the repeated RTI applications/ appeals of Shri P.K.

FAC
The First Appellate Authority vide order No. A/42021/26/2021- Admn(L&DO)-UD/255 dated 25.03.2022 directed CPIO to convey administrative decision in this regard within next 15 days. (copy attached) (iii) In compliance of Appellate Authority order dated 25.03.2022, CPIO provided the available information vide order No. A/42021/26/2021- Admn(L&DO)-UD/298 dated 04.04.2022. (copy attached).." The Complainant/Appellant narrated the factual background of these cases by stating chronologically that the property in question is a government-built one constructed in early 1950s, with the purpose to rehabilitate displaced persons from erstwhile West Punjab now called Pakistan during partition in 1947. Initial allotment of all such properties was on rent basis.	FAC
Later, Government of India decided to lease them on perpetual lease for 99 years. The Lease and Conveyance Deed for the complainant/appellant's property was executed in 1961 in the name of his late father. For the conveyance Deed, all information such as name of the lessee, father's/husband's name of the lessee, Tenement No. allotted and Block No., colony's name, constructed area of the tenement(s) allotted, premium charged, exclusive rights, joint rights with lessees of adjoining/adjacent tenements, rights about common use etc., were filled in by the public authority-the Lessor.	FAC
Later on, these tenements were constructed having two different areas viz. 255.75 sq. ft. and 287.5 sq. ft approx. without disclosing the same to the allottees. The cost charged per tenement as the premium etc., were the total cost of parcel of land called plot over which the Page 51 of 60 superstructure comprising a number of tenements were constructed and the total cost of construction equally proportionately charged from all the allottees of tenements in a particular Block.	FAC
The cost of these tenements thus varied from block to block depending upon the time of construction etc. These tenements were called Double Storey tenements and the rights between ground floor and first floor lessees were 50:50 basis.	FAC
In the instant cases, two adjoining tenements on the ground floor based on the criteria-number of family members out of 64 in a block were allotted to appellant's father since deceased. Thereafter, appellant's name was substituted as lessee in the public authority's record on 24.12.2010.	FAC
Similarly, in the case of other tenement, the complainant's/appellant's younger brother's name was substituted in the MOHUA's record in 2013. Later, on his demise on 02.01.2020, his wife's name was added as the substituted lessee. During 2010 and 2011, the overseer/surveyor while inspecting the complainant's/appellant's property as per lease terms, every time ignored measuring the actually constructed area vis-a-vis the one shown in the Lease Deed.	FAC
On 04.01.2017, the surveyor/overseer inspecting the property, measured and recorded his observation that the area recorded in the Lease Deed as 255.75 sq. ft. was incorrect as against the constructed area of 287.5 sq. ft. approx. Complainant/Appellant, thereafter, filed his request dated 08.02.2017 receipt duly diarized vide Dy. No.78681 the same day, for issuance of requisite corrigendum.	FAC
Instead, an alleged untenable demand dated 06.10.2017 was raised stating that the area of the tenement in the lessee's possession was in excess than shown in the lease deed along with payment of compound interest falsely alleging the lessee had defaulted in its payment whereas this alleged demand was never raised before. The interest demanded was for the period 8th Aug 1961, the date of execution of lease deed till the date of demand notice i.e. 6th Oct, 2017. The Complainant/Appellant challenged it vide his letter dated 27.10.2017 and sought pertinent information in justification of this alleged demand which has not been provided till date.	ARG
As regards hurdles created by the Government servants of the Respondent public authority to harass the public, the complainant/Appellant filed multiple representations on CPGRAM portal and personally handed over a copy of the same to the FAA/L&DO in a meeting held in her office on 3rd Dec, 2021. Instead of taking steps for efficiently resolving the matter, the FAA appears to have connived directing issuance of the illegal Blanket Order rejecting all Page 52 of 60 pending RTI applications and First Appeals. These Complaints and second appeals are a consequence due to obstructing transparency through malafide attempts by unscrupulous Government servants encouraging corrupt practices by creating hurdles.	ARG
The Complainant/Appellant further contended that neither the final outcome on his complaints under reference have been informed to him till date nor his issue regarding conversions of his property from lease hold to freehold has been addressed by the MOHUA despite multiple reminders and follow-ups. Such circumstances made the appellant (being around 75 years old) to run from pillar to post at this tender old age from the past more than 10 years and causes agony and harassment for which the complainant/appellant vehemently urged the Commission to direct the Respondent to pay compensation of Rs. 50,000/- against each case for hardships suffered by him.	ARG
In support of his arguments, he invited the attention of the Commission towards certain citations/case laws, which are taken on record. While summing up his arguments, the Complainant/Appellant narrated the sum and substance of his cases being deficiency in services on the part of Respondent public authority by not deciding his representations on following issues for which he made several visits and reminded them. 1. Necessary amendments/corrections in the Lease Deed with respect to variation in the measured area of the property vis-à-vis the one given in the Lease Deed. 2. Withdrawal of arbitrary and illegal demand notice issued in 2017. 3. Drop the arbitrary demand of huge sum through the demand notice of 2017 which levied compound rate of interest since 1961 without any prior notice for last five and a half decades. 4. Conversion of his Lease Deed to free hold property as per Government Policy. 5. Allotment of additional land in front corner of toilet area as committed by the Government. 6. Allotment of additional area for corner plot as his property is a corner one.	ARG
Page 53 of 60 Complainant/Appellant again prayed to the Commission that his prayer for award of compensation be taken into consideration for getting justice in the matter. Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO by inviting attention of the Commission towards the contents of his written submission stated that the complainant/appellant is a habitual RTI applicant who has filed numerous RTI applications in previous occasions seeking similar RTI applications which were replied to, however, to take the revenge from MoHUA he kept on filing various new RTI application against the reply of his previous RTI application just to clog the working system of the Respondent Public Authority. Therefore, after taking into account the conduct of the Complainant/Appellant a common order has been passed by the then CPIO, Mr. Niranjan Kumar Joshi, Dy.	ARG
Land & Development Officer on 09.11.2022 by rejecting all the pending RTI applications of the Complainant/Appellant. As regards the property issue, the Respondent apprised the Commission that his matter is under consideration and final decision is yet to be taken by the competent authority.	FAC
During the hearing, he prayed the Commission to advise the complainant/appellant to limit his claim for information precisely to enable the CPIO to facilitate the requested information. Upon being queried by the Commission regarding status of reply in case File Nos. CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/140886, CIC/LADOF/C/2023/146940, CIC/LADOF/C/2023/146942, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148267, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148268, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148269, Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/ CPIO tendered his apology by explaining that no response was unintentional and may be condoned in the interest of justice.	ARG
Decision The above-mentioned bunch of Complaints and Second Appeals of Mr. Pramod Kumar Oberoi have been heard simultaneously and disposed through common order for the sake of brevity as these relates to similar issues raised by him against same Respondent Public Authority. In case File Nos. CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/135478, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/135479, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/135477 and CIC/LADOF/C/2023/134547: Page 54 of 60 The Commission, after adverting to the facts and circumstances of the case, and perusal of the records notes that the core contention raised in these matters by the Complainant/Appellant was non-receipt of final action taken report from the Nodal RTI officer to whom RTI applications has been transferred at the relevant time.	RPC
Here, the Commission would like to counsel the parties that instant matters are complaints filed under Section 18 of the RTI Act, where no further direction for disclosure of information can be given in the light of the judgement decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Chief Information Commissioner and another Vs. State of Manipur & Another reported in MANU/SC/1484/2011 : AIR 2012 SC 864. The role of CIC is restricted only to ascertain if the information has been denied with a mala-fide intention or due to an unreasonable cause. Upon perusal of the facts on record, the Commission at the outset is unhappy with the fact that no reply has ever been provided by the concerned transferee Nodal CPIO to whom RTI applications have been transferred under Section 6(3) of the RTI Act.	PRE
Further, no cogent explanation for such violation/delay has been tendered by the Respondent during the hearing. Accordingly, the Commission expresses severe displeasure on the conduct of the concerned transferee CPIO for neither providing any reply against the instant RTI Applications.	RPC
The act of the concerned CPIO, tramples upon the citizen's right under the RTI Act as well as shows lack of respect towards the Commission. In view of the above, inaction on his part is prima facie established and therefore, the Commission deems it expedient to direct the Registry of this Bench to issue Show Cause Notice to the concerned the then transferee CPIO (at the relevant time), and the present CPIO, Mr. Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO.	RPC
The CPIOs shall explain in writing as to why action should not be initiated against them under Section 20(1) and 20(2) of the RTI Act for the foregoing reasons, written explanation of the CPIOs should reach the Commission within six weeks from the date of receipt of this order. Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO, MOHUA should ensure service of this order at the address for correspondence of the then CPIO(s) for timely compliance of the above- mentioned directions. Page 55 of 60 Meanwhile, the Commission advises Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO to take all necessary steps to procure the available information against each point as sought for in these RTI Applications from the concerned record holder under Section 5(4) of the RTI Act and provide the same directly to the Complainant/Appellant within reasonable time.

Land & Development Officer on 09.11.2022 by rejecting all the pending RTI applications of the Complainant/Appellant; ignoring the fact that the queries raised by the Complainant/Appellant in each RTI application is distinguishable, hence, the rejection is unacceptable in the eyes of law.	RPC
The CPIOs' were expected to have applied their minds while responding to each RTI Application separately on merits, by giving available information in consonance with the spirit of RTI Act . They ought to have intimated regarding availability/non-availability of information to the Appellant.	Ratio
And if at all any exemption was to claimed it should have been done with full justification quoting the relevant clause of Section 8 or section 9 of the RTI Act, wherever applicable. The conduct of the then CPIO and the present CPIO depict that the instant cases were badly handled.	RPC
It amounts to causing unwarranted obstruction to the Complainant's/Appellant's right to information. In view of the above, inaction on the respondent's part is prima facie established and therefore, the Commission deems it expedient to direct the Registry of this Bench to issue Show Cause Notice to concern the then CPIO, Page 56 of 60 Mr. Niranjan Kumar Joshi, Dy.	RPC
Land & Development Officer and the present CPIO, Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO. The CPIOs shall explain in writing as to why action should not be initiated against them under Section 20(1) and 20(2) of the RTI Act for the foregoing reasons, written explanation of the CPIOs should reach the Commission within six weeks from the date of receipt of this order. Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO, MOHUA should ensure service of this order at the address for correspondence of the then CPIO(s) for timely compliance of the above-mentioned directions.	RPC
Now coming to relief of information sought by the Complainant/Appellant is concerned, the Commission is of the view that the reply furnished by Mr. Dinesh Kumar Lakhumna, Dy. L & DO/ CPIO now in case File Nos. CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/104373, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/109238, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/110006, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/110007, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/110008, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/110009, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/121795 and CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/124061 vide written submission are in consonance with the provisions of the RTI Act , merits of which cannot be called into question. Hence, no additional relief can be granted in these six matters. However, in the spirit of the RTI Act , Mr. Dinesh Kumar Lakhumna, Dy. L & DO/ CPIO is directed to provide a copy of his latest written submission along with enclosures, free of cost, to the complainant/appellant within one week of the date of receipt of this order.	RPC
Nonetheless, in case File Nos. CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/104375, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/106214, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/106209, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/106211, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/106215, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/109235, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/109236, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/109237, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/121795, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/124061, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/127636 and CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/110010, the Commission further directs Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO to revisit the contents of each RTI application and provide a revised point-wise updated reply separately along with relevant information as per the provisions of the RTI Act , free of cost, to the Complainant/Appellant within six weeks from the date of receipt of this order. Page 57 of 60 FAA to ensure compliance of the above directions.	RPC
In case File No. CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/161186, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/140886, CIC/LADOF/C/2023/146940, CIC/LADOF/C/2023/146942, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148267, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148268, CIC/MOHUA/C/2023/148269. The Commission advises Mr. Rajeev Kumar Das, Dy. L & DO/CPIO to take all necessary steps to procure the available information against each point as sought for in the each of RTI Applications in these cases from the concerned record holder under Section 5(4) of the RTI Act and provide the same directly to the Complainant/Appellant within reasonable time.	RPC
In case File Nos. CIC/LADOF/A/2023/106205, CIC/LADOF/A/2023/121794, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/124059, CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/124060 and CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/127635: The Commission upon hearing submissions of both the parties and perusal of records observes that the reply furnished by the respondent against these five cases are as per the provisions of the RTI Act . Hence, no additional relief can be granted in the matter.	RPC
However, in the spirit of the RTI Act , Mr. Dinesh Kumar Lakhumna, Dy. L & DO/ CPIO, for case File No. CIC/MOHUA/A/2023/127635, is directed to provide a copy of his latest written submission along with enclosures, free of cost, to the appellant within one week from the date of receipt of this order. Lastly, as regards the prayer for award of compensation to the Complainant/Appellant, the Commission notes with concern that the Appellant/Complainant Shri Pramod Kumar Oberoi is a senior citizen aged around 75 years, who is being made to run from pillar to post to get a resolution to his issues pertaining to Lease Deed and other connected matters for the property under reference.	RPC
The fact remains that his issues have not been resolved till date even after a period of about last five and a half decades. Appellant/complainant cannot approach any Court of Law as it would be termed as premature litigation.	ARG
Hence, it is natural for him to obtain a decision on his pending representations for which, he had no other choice but to file Page 58 of 60 multiple RTI applications and First Appeals with the Respondent Public Authority. Taking into count of all of the above-mentioned facts, the Commission finds it pertinent to address the issue raised by the Complainant/Appellant for awarding compensation under Section 19 (8) (b) of the RTI Act, since the Complainant/Appellant prime facie established that he has suffered hardships due to inaction of the Respondent by not furnishing reply to his several RTI applications or delaying them inordinately besides keeping his representations pending since long.	Ratio
Hence, the Appellant is advised to file his detailed quantum of claim for compensation supported by necessary documents before the Commission with a copy marked to the Respondent, within four weeks from the date of receipt of this order. Upon receipt of the claim from the Complainant/Appellant, the Respondents are directed to file their reply to the Commission within four weeks, thereafter, with a copy marked to the Complainant/Appellant.
