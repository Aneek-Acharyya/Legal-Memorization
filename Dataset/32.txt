She was thoroughly cross examined by Ld. Addl. PP for the State. 6. Thereafter, matter was fixed for final arguments. ARGUMENTS 7. I have heard Sh.	ARG
Nishant Kumar, Ld. Addl. PP for the State and Mr. Prashant Mendiratta, Ld.	ARG
Counsel for accused persons and perused the entire record. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 23 of 54 8. It was argued by Ld.	ARG
Addl. PP that the allegations levelled against the accused are of serious nature. It was further argued that all the witnesses have clearly proved the manner of offence and prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.	ARG
That merely because some of the witnesses have not deposed entirely in favour of the prosecution, that alone cannot absolve the guilt of the accused persons and the relevant portion of their testimony can be read. 9. Per contra, Mr. Prashant Mendiratta, Ld. Counsel for the accused persons has argued that accused persons have been falsely implicated.	ARG
It was further argued that prime prosecution witnesses had not supported the case of the prosecution and there was no incriminating evidence against them and the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. It was specifically argued that the witnesses have made their statements based upon hearsay.	ARG
The initial police officials, who had reached the spot i.e. Raj Kumar and HC Chatter Mal did not say anything about the identity of the injured despite the accused along with other family members were present at the spot and deceased was found sitting at the staircase and was murmuring something.	FAC
It has been further submitted that accused Gulabo Devi was taken to hospital first by HC Chattar Mal but the prosecution has failed to explain as to how MLC was prepared subsequent to the MLC of the injured. That there were no external injury which had been found on the body of the deceased as per the postmortem report and the allegations of SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	ARG
Page 24 of 54 physical assault are baseless and afterthought and that is why there is delay in lodging of FIR. The material public witnesses PW12 Mohd.	ARG
Ayub, PW15 Pawan Kumar Arora and PW19 Manmeet have not supported the case of the prosecution and there is no weapon of offence, if any, which had been recovered nor the manner in which the death was caused and the role attributed to each accused has been explained by the prosecution. It is defence of the accused persons is that a prior civil litigation and FIR had been registered against the deceased under Section 354 / 323 IPC prior on behalf of the accused party and capitalizing the death of the deceased due to sudden fall, a false case had been registered against the accused by the sons of the deceased.	ARG
Thereafter, an amicable settlement had arrived at in the concerned civil court by the sons of the deceased vide settlement agreement dated 23.12.2022 wherein they admitted that accused persons are not responsible for the death of their father. Accordingly, accused deserve acquittal. FINDINGS 10. The accused persons had been charged for the commission of offence punishable under Section 302 / 34 IPC. 11. The relevant Section is reproduced as under for the sake of clarity: SECTION 302 IPC "Punishment for murder.--Whoever SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	ARG
Page 25 of 54 commits murder shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine." SECTION 34 IPC "When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone". 12. It is a settled law of criminal jurisprudence that a person is believed to be innocent till the guilt is proved against him.	STA
This principle is called The Presumption of Innocence. In another words, the accused is entitled to take advantage of reasonable doubt in respect of his crime.	Ratio
The principle finds its genesis in the Declaration of Human Rights under Article 11 Section 1 incorporated by the United Nations in 1948. It is also mentioned in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights in Article 6 Section 2 and United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights under Article 14 , Section 2 . Presumption of Innocence is a re-statement of the rule that in criminal matters the prosecution has the burden of proving guilt of the accused in order to be convicted of the crime of which he is charged.	STA
In Chandrashekhar Vs. State of Himachal Pradesh decided on 06.07.2018 relying on judgment of Data Ram Singh Vs. State of UP passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court on 06.02.2018, it was held that: "the freedom of an individual is SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 26 of 54 utmost important and cannot be curtailed specially when guilt if any, is yet to be proved.	PRE
It is settled law that till such time guilt of a person is proved, he is deemed to be innocent........ A fundamental postulate of criminal juris prudence is a presumption of innocence meaning thereby that a person is believed to be innocent until found guilty.......... Thus, the inference which is culled out from the above is that it is for the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. 13. In this backdrop, I proceed to delve upon the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution. MATERIAL WITNESSES 14. PW7 HC Majid Khan, he was one of the first police officials, who had reached the spot along with HC Chatter Mal on receipt of a wireless information regarding quarrel between the landlord K.L.	PRE
Sharma and the tenant Smt.Gulabo Devi and her family members (accused persons). He categorically deposed that Smt. Gulabo Devi met him and informed that she had a quarrel with Sh. K.L.	FAC
Sharma regarding the dispute of tenancy. Sh. K.L.	FAC
Sharma also present when Smt. Gulabo Devi informed him. He further deposed that he inquired from Smt. Gulabo Devi as well as Sh. K.L.	FAC
Sharma regarding any injury to them. On this, Smt. Gulabo Devi told him that she sustained internal injury / Gum Chot and she wished to be taken to the hospital for her medical examination. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC
Page 27 of 54 That Sh. K.L. Sharma was inquired if there was any injury on his person, on this, he denied to accompany them to the hospital for his medical examination.	FAC
He further deposed that only Smt. Gulabo Devi accompanied them to the hospital for her medical examination. They took Smt. Gulabo Devi to B.S.A.	FAC
Hospital where she was got admitted for her medical examination. Thus, from the testimony of PW7 it transpires firstly that accused had been taken to the hospital but prosecution has failed to explain that how her MLC 5605 is subsequent to the MLC of K.L.	FAC
Sharma bearing no. 5604 of the same hospital. That as per the version of the prosecution story K.L.	FAC
Sharma himself refused to go to hospital and PW7 took Gulabo Devi for her medical examination. Secondly, there was no apparent injury caused to the K.L.	FAC
Sharma and he was very much conscious and talking and refused to go to the hospital for any medical examination. From the very examination in chief of PW7, it transpires that it was Gulabo Devi, who had infact sustained internal injuries/gum chot and wished to be taken to hospital for her medical examination.	FAC
Even as per the postmortem report bearing no. 300/2011, Ex.PW14/A, no fresh external injuries were seen on the body of the deceased. Thus, the very basis of the prosecution story about a deadly physical assault by all the accused person upon K.L.	FAC
Sharma comes under cloud. PW7 in his cross examination conducted by ld. Counsel for accused persons, admitted that when he inquired SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC
Page 28 of 54 K.L. Sharma as to whether he was injured and whether he wants to accompany him to the hospital, K.L.	FAC
Sharma denied the same. The relevant part of his cross-examination is reproduced herein for the sake of reference: "It is correct that when I inquired from K.L.	FAC
Sharma, whether he wants to come with us to the hospital, he denied the same. He is the person who first visited the spot on 10.07.2011, as per the prosecution story and admitted the fact in his cross-examination that he did not see any physical injury on the person of K.L.	FAC
Sharma (since deceased). Moving forward, I now delve upon the testimony of other material public witnesses. OTHER MATERIAL WITNESS 15. The prime prosecution witness were PW4 Praveen Kumar Sharma and PW9 Ravinder Kumar sons of the deceased. PW4 Praveen Kumar Sharma He has deposed that his Late father Sh. K.L.	FAC
Sharma, owned a house No. H-3/79, Sector-11, Rohini, Delhi which was constructed upto second floor (GF, FF and SF). That first floor of the said house was occupied by tenant accused Gulabo Devi, who is residing there alongwith her children ie.	FAC

He further deposed that on 10.07.2011 he had gone to Chhatisgarh on his official tour. That on the same day at about 07.00 p.m, he received a call from his brother Ravinder Kumar Sharma who told him that their tenant had severally beaten his father who had received severe injury on his head.	FAC
He further told him that father has been taken to Ambedkar Hospital, who has been referred to Shushrut Trauma Centre, near Majnu ka Tila. He further deposed that on the next day, he took a flight for Delhi from Chhatisgarh and from the Airport, he directly reached Trauma Centre at about 09.00 a.m.	FAC
He met his brother there, who told him that somebody by the name of Ayub Khan called him by telephone and told him that their tenants had severally beaten their father. He further deposed that Rakhi was also present at the spot at the time of quarrel.	FAC
An FIR bearing no. 337/11 was lodged against his father which. He further deposed that he alongwith his brother Sh.	FAC
Ravinder Sharma went to Sector-11, Rohini, Delhi, where their house is situated. That they met the neighbourers of accused persons namely Manpreet and Pawan Arora, who informed them that on 10.07.2011 his father Sh. K.L.	FAC
Sharma was given beatings for causing internal injury on his head by the accused persons in their house. They also informed him that on 10.07.2011 they heard noise from the house of accused persons SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC
Page 30 of 54 where their father was beaten. Thereafter, they met one Ayub Khan, who used to supply building material and he informed them that his late father was sitting with him in his shop and at about 4/4.30 PM he received a telephone call from accused Gulabo Devi.	FAC
That Ayub Khan also informed them that their late father informed him that Gulabo Devi is calling him at her house. He further deposed that his father was disturbed on the said day as informed to them by Ayub Khan.	FAC
That Ayub Khan also informed them that his late father discussed with him that accused Gulabo Devi is not paying rent to his late father and not vacating the tenanted premises / house and used to quarrel with his late father. That Ayub Khan also informed them that his late father left his shop and went to the tenanted premises where accused persons including her daughter Rakhi gave beatings to his late father and causing internal injuries on the body of his father resulting his death.	FAC
He further deposed that he identified the dead body of his father vide his statement Ex. PW-4/A. That the postmortem on the body of his father was conducted in BSA Hospital and after the postmortem on the body of his father, the dead body was handed over to them vide dead body handing over memo Ex. PW-9/B. PW9 Ravinder Kumar He has deposed on the similar lines as his brother/PW4.	FAC
He further deposed that on 10.07.2011 at about 6.45 p.m. he received a telephone call from HC Chhatar Pal, who informed him that his father had met with an accident and SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 31 of 54 admitted in Ambedkar Hospital.	FAC
That he along with his relatives reached at Ambedkar Hospital in a case and in the hospital, found his late father in unconscious condition and he was being removed in an ambulance. He further deposed that the senior doctors of the hospital advised him to accompany his father in the ambulance.	FAC
That he boarded the ambulance in which his father was shifted Trauma Centre, ISBT Delhi. He further deposed that in the ambulance, he made a call to his younger brother Parveen, who was attending his official tour at Chhatisgarh.	FAC
He further deposed that he informed his brother that their father is in bad condition. He got admitted his father in Trauma Centre.	FAC
He further deposed that senior doctors informed him that his father sustained a serious injury in his head and the said injury cannot be operated due to the old age of his father. That thereafter, he went to Rohini, Sector - 11 at the tenanted premises, where he met Manpreet Singh, who is the neighbour of the said house, informed him that he heard noise of his father from the tenanted house.	FAC
He further deposed that Manpreet Singh and Pawan Arora also informed him that his father had been severally beaten and they also informed him that all accused persons and their other family members were present at their house and they all gave beatings to his father in the said house at Rohini. He further deposed that two days since the admission of his father in Trauma Centre, Ayub Khan reached in the hospital and informed them that when my father went to his property, Rohini, Sector - 11, he has fear in his mind that some SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC
Page 32 of 54 incident may took place with him. Both PW4 and PW9 deposed on similar lines. PW4 Praveen Kumar Sharma is merely a hearsay witness and was not present at the spot and was at Chhatisgarh at that time.	FAC
He had named one Ayub Khan and that he and his brother Ravinder Sharma/PW9 met Ayub Khan, who used to supply building material and it is Ayub Khan who informed PW4 and PW9 that K.L. Sharma had left his shop and went to the tenanted premises where the accused persons including Rakhi gave beatings to their late father which resulted in his death.	FAC
At the very outset, it is pertinent to mentioned that said Rakhi has not been made an accused in the present case. Further, no complaint admittedly had been lodged by the said witness against Gulabo Devi or her family members prior to 10.07.2011 and infact he denied if he had any knowledge of any prior civil litigation filed by his father.	FAC
He further stated that two three relative namely Anil and Ashu had accompanied her brother to the hospital but the said Anil and Ashu had not been made witnesses in the present case by the prosecution. PW9 Ravinder Kumar, another son of deceased is again a hearsay witness and was not present at the spot at the time of incident and deposed that he infact received a call from HC Chattar Pal regarding the fact that his father met with an accident. This is completely off the prosecution story.	ARG
There is no mention of alleged physical assault by the accused persons. Even, he testified on the lines of his brother/PW4 that they had met Ayub Khan, Manpreet Singh and Pawan Arora. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC
Page 33 of 54 Thus, from the testimonies both PW4 and PW9, nothing incriminating could be culled out against the accused persons. 16. Now, I proceed further to analyse the testimonies of other material public witnesses i.e. PW12 Ayub Khan, PW15 Pawan Arora and PW19 Manmeet Singh, who had been named by the sons of the deceased as having first hand information of incident. PW12 Ayub Khan He has deposed that he was running business of building material and was known to K.L. Sharma (since deceased) for the last many years prior to his death as he used to purchase raw material from him.	FAC
He further deposed that as and when deceased visited Sector - 11, he used to meet him and H.No. H-3/79, Sector 11, Rohini, belongs to Sh.K.L. Sharma.	FAC
He further deposed that in the year 2011, deceased was residing at Narela along with his family and except the aforesaid facts, he do not know anything about this case. PW15 Pawan Kumar Arora He has deposed that he was not an eye witness to the incident. He has deposed that on the date of incident, he had gone to his factory at 11.00 a.m. and when he returned home at about 8.00 p.m., he saw public persons had gathered there and police was also present there.	FAC
He further deposed that he came to know that my neighbour Sh.K.L. Sharma had sustained injuries in a quarrel and he had been taken to hospital.	FAC
He further stated that SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 34 of 54 he do not know anything about this case. PW19 Manmeet @ Sunny He has deposed that in the month of March 2012, he along with his family were residing at H-3/78, Sector - 11, Rohini, Delhi, as a tenant.	FAC
That they had shifted to aforesaid house in the month of November 2011. That accused persons were residing in his neighborhood as tenants. He further stated that he do not know anything about this case and except this do not want to say anything else in this case.	FAC
All the said independent witnesses have not supported the case of the prosecution and resiled from their earlier respective statements and despite a lengthy cross- examination by ld. Addl. PP for the State, nothing incriminating could be culled out against the accused. DELAY IN LODGING THE FIR 17. At this very outset, it is pertinent to discuss the case law on the point of delay in lodging the FIR.	PRE
In the case of Jai Prakash Singh Vs. State of Bihar (2012) 4 SCC 379, it was observed as under: "The FIR in a criminal case is vital and valuable piece of evidence, though may not be substantive piece of evidence. The object of insisting upon prompt lodging of the FIR in respect of commission of an offence is to obtain early information regarding the circumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of actual culprits, the part played by them as well as the names of eye witnesses present at the scene of occurrence..............	PRE
Undoubtedly, the SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 35 of 54 promptness in lodging the FIR is an assurance regarding the truth of the informant's version. A promptly lodged FIR reflects the first hand account of what has actually happened and who was responsible for the offence in question".	PRE
In the case of Tulshidas Kanolkar Vs. State of Goa (2003) 8 SCC 590, it is observed as under: Delay in lodging the first information report cannot be used as a ritualistic formula f or discarding the prosecution case and doubting its authenticity. It only puts the court on guard to search for and consider if any explanation has been offered for the delay.	PRE
Once it is offered, the court is to only see whether it is satisfactory or not. In case if the prosecution fails to satisfactorily explain the delay and there is possibility of embellishment or exaggeration in the prosecution version on account of such delay, it is a relevant factor."	PRE
However, given the facts and circumstances of the present case where neither the manner of the offence nor the weapon if any recovered and the material public witnesses having not supported the case of the prosecution it becomes a suspicious factor as to why there was delay in lodging the FIR. The incident allegedly happened on 10.07.2011 at about 5.00 p.m and FIR has been registered on the next day i.e. 11.07.2011 at late night at about 1'o clock and that too under Section 308 / 34 IPC and the injured died almost 10 days after the incident and only then Section 304 IPC was incorporated.	FAC
In the present case, thus, the prosecution has failed SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 36 of 54 to explain the delay in lodging the FIR, which although does not effect the merits of the case, however, puts the Court on guard and creates a grave doubt in prosecution story, especially in the wake of material prosecution witnesses not supporting the case of the prosecution. MEDICAL/FORENSIC EVIDENCE 18. PW14 Dr. Vijay Dhankar proved the PM report No. 300/2011 and proved the same as Ex.PW14/A.	ARG
He has opined that death was due to cerebral damage consequent to blunt force impact to the head. All injuries are ante mortem and could be caused in a physical assault.	FAC
The head injury is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. From the testimony of PW7 it transpires firstly that accused had been taken to the hospital but prosecution has failed to explain that how MLC of Gulabo Devi bearing no.5605 is subsequent to the MLC of K.L.	FAC
Sharma bearing no. 5604 of the same hospital. That as per the version of the prosecution story K.L.	FAC
Sharma himself refused to go to hospital and PW7 took Gulabo Devi for her medical examination. Secondly, there was no apparent external injuries caused to the K.L.	FAC
Sharma and he was very much conscious and talking and refused to go to the hospital for any medical examination. From the very examination in chief of PW7, it transpires that it was Gulabo Devi, who had infact sustained internal injuries/gum chot and wished to be taken to hospital for her medical examination.

Sharma comes under cloud. PW7 is the person who first visited the spot on 10.07.2011, as per the prosecution story and admitted the fact in his cross-examination that he did not see any physical injury on the person of K.L. Sharma (since deceased).	FAC
There is no forensic evidence lifted from the crime scene which could suggest any signs of scuffle or struggle or that which has been sent for further investigation to the lab which could be incriminating against the accused persons. WEAPON OF OFFENCE/MANNER OF CRIME 19. There is no weapon of offence seized whatsoever or manner in which the injury was inflicted and the prosecution has failed to prove that if at all the deceased had sustained injuries, they were caused by the accused persons. Even as per the postmortem report bearing no. 300/2011, Ex.PW14/A, no fresh external injuries were seen on the body of the deceased.	FAC

She further deposed that in order to grab their property, the son of the deceased Ravinder Kumar had falsely implicated them in this FIR to put pressure. That thereafter, an amicable settlement had been arrived at between them and the complainant party regarding the said property vide settlement agreement dated 23.12.2022 which had been filed in the concerned court of Ld. ADJ-02, North West, Rohini and consequent to the settlement the civil litigation had been withdrawn.	ARG
The copy of the said settlement is Ex.DW1/A. She further deposed that in the said settlement specifically in para No.I, the complainant/sons of the deceased had admitted that the accused persons (Gulabo Devi and her children) are not responsible for their father's death.	FAC
The relevant portion of the agreement as reproduced herein: "There have been litigations pending between the parties including case FIR No.333/2011 dated 11.07.2011 under Section 302 / 34 IPC, PS Prashant Vihar, New Delhi, in which FIR, charge sheet has been filed and in the said FIR, the Second Party has been one of the witness as he had believed that the First Party and her two children were responsible for the death of his father, however, during the pendency of the cases and especially after speaking to various witnesses who came to depose in the Court and following it up, the Second Party has realised that the First Party and her children were not responsible for the death of his father and consequently both the First Party and Second Party wish to put a quietus to all the litigations."

The said K.L. Sharma died after 09 days of the incident i.e. on 19.07.2011.	FAC

At this stage, it is imperative to note the relevant case law on the point of Section 302 IPC and the essential ingredients of intention or knowledge of the act to cause culpable homicide. In the case titled as Mohd.	PRE
Rafiq @ Kallu Vs. The State of Madhya Pradesh, Criminal Appeal No. 856/2021 decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: 11. The question of whether in a given case, a homicide is murder, punishable under Section 302 IPC, or culpable homicide, of either description punishable under Section 304 IPC has engaged the attention of courts in this country for over one and a half century, since the enactment of the IPC ; a welter of case law, on this aspect exists, including perhaps several hundred rulings by this court. The use of the term "likely" in several places in respect of culpable homicide, highlights the element of uncertainty that the act of the accused may or may not have killed the person.	PRE
Section 300 IPC which defines murder, however refrains from the use of the term likely, which reveals absence of ambiguity left on behalf of the accused. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 40 of 54 The accused is for sure that his act will definitely cause death.	STA
It is often difficult to distinguish between culpable homicide and murder as both involve death. Yet, there is a subtle distinction of intention and knowledge involved in both the crimes.	PRE
This difference lies in the degree of the act. There is a very wide variance of degree of intention and knowledge among both the crimes.	PRE
In the case of State of Andhra Pradesh v Rayavarapu Punnayya & Anr 1977 AIR SC 45 notes the important distinction between the two provisions, and their differing, but subtle distinction. The Hon'ble Supreme Court pertinently pointed out that: "12.	PRE
In the scheme of the Penal Code, "culpable homicide" is genus and "murder" its specie. All "murder" is "culpable homicide" but not vice- versa.	PRE
Speaking generally, "culpable homicide" sans "special characteristics of murder", is "culpable homicide not amounting to murder". For the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide.	PRE
The first is, what may be called, "culpable homicide of the first degree". This is the greatest form of culpable homicide, which is defined in Section 300 as "murder".	STA
The second may be termed as "culpable homicide of the second degree". This is punishable under the first part of Section 304. Then, there is "culpable homicide of the third degree".	STA
This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is, also, the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades. Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the second part of Section 304.. 13. The academic distinction between SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	STA
Page 41 of 54 "murder" and "culpable homicide not amounting to murder" has vexed the courts for more than a century. The confusion is caused, if courts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms used by the legislature in these sections, allow themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions.	Ratio
The safest way of approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems to be to keep in focus the keywords used in the various clauses of Sections 299 and 300." 13. The considerations that should weigh with courts, in discerning whether an act is punishable as murder, or culpable homicide, not amounting to murder, 1976 (4) SCC 382 were outlined in Pulicherla Nagaraju @ Nagaraja Reddy v State of Andhra Pradesh . This court observed that: "29.	PRE
Therefore, the Court should proceed to decide the pivotal question of intention, with care and caution, as that will decide whether the case falls under Section 302 or 304 Part I or 304 Part II. Many petty or insignificant matters - plucking of a fruit, straying of cattle, quarrel of children, utterance of a rude word or even an objectionable glance, may lead to altercations and group clashes culminating in deaths.	PRE
Usual motives like revenge, greed, jealousy or suspicion may be totally absent in such cases. There may be no intention.	PRE
There may be no premeditation. In fact, there may not even be criminality.	PRE
At the other end of the spectrum, there may be cases of murder where the accused attempts to avoid the penalty for murder by attempting to put forth a case that there was no intention to cause death. It is for the courts to ensure that the cases of murder punishable under Section 302, are not converted into offences punishable under Section 304 Part I/II, or cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder are treated as murder punishable under Section 302. The intention to cause SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	PRE
Page 42 of 54 death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or several of the following, among other, circumstances; (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii) whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any premeditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger;(viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The above list of circumstances is, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with reference to individual cases which may throw light on the question of intention."	PRE
In the case of N. Ram Kumar Vs. State decided by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Crl. A. No. 2006/2023, it has been held as under: 14. The cause of death assigned in the post- mortem report as already noticed is "died of head injury".	PRE
It is a trite law that "culpable homicide" is a genus and "murder" is its species and all "murders" are "culpable homicides, but all "culpable homicides" are not "murders" as held by this court in Rampal Singh Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2012) 8 SCC 289. The intention of the accused must be judged not in the light of actual circumstances, but in the light of what is supposed to be the circumstances. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 43 of 54 In the case of Basdev Vs. State of Pepsu AIR 1956 SC 488 at page 490 the following observations have been made: "Of course, we have to distinguish between motive, intention and knowledge.	PRE
Motive is something which prompts a man to form an intention and knowledge is an awareness of the consequences of the act. In many cases intention and knowledge merge into each other and mean the same thing more or less and intention can be presumed from knowledge.	PRE
The demarcating line between knowledge and intention is no doubt thin but it is not difficult to perceive that they connote different things. Even in some English decisions, the three ideas are used interchangeably and this has led to a certain amount of confusion."	PRE
From the aforesaid landmark judgments, it emerges that, it requires to be borne in mind that the test suggested in the aforesaid decisions and the fact that the legislature has used two different terminologies, 'intent' and 'knowledge' and separate punishments are provided for an act committed with an intent to cause bodily injury which is likely to cause death and for an act committed with a knowledge that his act is likely to cause death without intent to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it would be unsafe to treat 'intent' and 'knowledge' in equal terms. Knowledge would be one of the circumstances to be taken into consideration while determining or inferring the requisite intent. Where the evidence would not disclose that there was any intention to cause death of the deceased but it was clear SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	PRE
Page 44 of 54 that the accused had knowledge that his acts were likely to cause death, the accused can be held guilty under second part of Section 304 IPC. It is in this background that the expression used in Indian Penal Code namely "intention" and "knowledge" has to be seen as there being a thin line of distinction between these two expressions. The act to constitute murder, if in given facts and circumstances, would disclose that the ingredients of Section 300 are not satisfied and such act is one of extreme recklessness, it would not attract the said Section. In order to bring a case within Part 3 of Section 300 IPC, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which in the ordinary course of nature was sufficient to cause death.	PRE
In other words, that the injury found to be present was the injury that was intended to be inflicted. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pulicherla Nagaraju @ Nagaraja Reddy vs State of Andhra Pradesh , AIR 2006 SC 3010 has further observed: "Therefore, the court should proceed to decide the pivotal question of intention, with care and caution, as that will decide whether the case falls under Section 302 or 304 Part I or 304 Part II.

At the other end of the spectrum, there may be cases of murder where the accused attempts to avoid the penalty for murder by attempting to put forth a case that there was no intention to cause death. It is for the courts to ensure that the cases of murder punishable under Section 302, are not converted into offences punishable under Section 304 Part I/II, or cases of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, are treated as murder punishable under Section 302. The intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or several of the following, among other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii) whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any premeditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows.	PRE
The above list of circumstances is, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with reference to individual cases which may throw SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 46 of 54 light on the question of intention.	PRE
Be that as it may. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pratap Singh @ Pikki v. State of Uttarakhand (2019) 7 SCC 424 had noticed that the deceased-victim had suffered total 11 injuries and had been convicted for offences under Section 304 Part- II/ Section 34 IPC apart from other offences.	PRE
It was noticed that some altercation took place and the groups entered into scuffle without any premeditation and convicted accused for the offence punishable under Section 304 Part-II/ Section 34 IPC. In the case of Deepak v. State of Uttar Pradesh reported in (2018) 8 SCC 228 it came to be noticed by this Court that incident had taken place in the heat of the moment and the assault was by a single sword blow in the rib cage was without any premeditation and incident had occurred at the spur of the moment, and thus inferred there was no intention to kill and as such the offence was converted from Section 302 IPC to Section 304 Part II IPC and the appellant was ordered to be released forthwith by sentencing them to the period of conviction already undergone. It was held: "7.	PRE
On consideration of the entirety of the evidence, it can safely be concluded that the occurrence took place in the heat of the moment and the assault was made without premeditation on the spur of time. The fact that the appellant may have rushed to his house across the road and returned with a sword, is not sufficient to infer an intention to kill, both because of the genesis of the occurrence and the single assault by the appellant, coupled with the duration of the entire episode for SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	PRE
Page 47 of 54 1½ to 2 minutes. Had there been any intention to do away with the life of the deceased, nothing prevented the appellant from making a second assault to ensure his death, rather than to have run away.	PRE
The intention appears more to have been to teach a lesson by the venting of ire by an irked neighbour, due to loud playing of the tape recorder. But in the nature of weapon used, the assault made in the rib-cage area, knowledge that death was likely to ensue will have to be attributed to the appellant.	PRE
The Hon'ble Supreme Court in a recent judgment in the case of Anbazhagan vs. The State represented by the Inspector of Police in Criminal Appeal No.2043 of 2023 disposed of on 20.07.2023 has defined the context of the true test to be adopted to find out the intention or knowledge of the accused in doing the act as under: "60. Few important principles of law discernible from the aforesaid discussion may be summed up thus: (1) When the court is confronted with the question, what offence the accused could be said to have committed, the true test is to find out the intention or knowledge of the accused in doing the act.	PRE
If the intention or knowledge was such as is described in Clauses (1) to (4) of Section 300 of the IPC, the act will be murder even though only a single injury was caused. (2) Even when the intention or knowledge of the accused may fall within Clauses (1) to (4) of Section 300 of the IPC, the act of the accused which would otherwise be murder, will be taken out of the purview of murder, if the accused's case attracts any one of the five exceptions enumerated SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 48 of 54 in that section. In the event of the case falling within any of those exceptions, the offence would be culpable homicide not amounting to murder, falling within Part 1 of Section 304 of the IPC, if the case of the accused is such as to fall within Clauses (1) to (3) of Section 300 of the IPC. It would be offence under Part II of Section 304 if the case is such as to fall within Clause (4) of Section 300 of the IPC. Again, the intention or knowledge of the accused may be such that only 2nd or 3rd part of Section 299 of the IPC, may be attracted but not any of the clauses of Section 300 of the IPC. In that situation also, the offence would be culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the IPC. It would be an offence under Part I of that section, if the case fall within 2nd part of Section 299, while it would be an offence under Part II of Section 304 if the case fall within 3rd part of Section 299 of the IPC. (3) To put it in other words, if the act of an accused person falls within the first two clauses of cases of culpable homicide as described in Section 299 of the IPC it is punishable under the first part of Section 304. If, however, it falls within the third clause, it is punishable under the second part of Section 304. In effect, therefore, the first part of this section would apply when there is 'guilty intention,' whereas the second part would apply when there is no such intention, but there is 'guilty knowledge'. (4) Even if single injury is inflicted, if that particular injury was intended, and objectively that injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the requirements of Clause 3rdly to Section 300 of the IPC, are fulfilled and the offence would be murder. (5) Section 304 of the IPC will apply to SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	STA
Page 49 of 54 the following classes of cases : (i) when the case falls under one or the other of the clauses of Section 300, but it is covered by one of the exceptions to that Section, (ii) when the injury caused is not of the higher degree of likelihood which is covered by the expression 'sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death' but is of a lower degree of likelihood which is generally spoken of as an injury 'likely to cause death' and the case does not fall under Clause (2) of Section 300 of the IPC, (iii) when the act is done with the knowledge that death is likely to ensue but without intention to cause death or an injury likely to cause death. To put it more succinctly, the difference between the two parts of Section 304 of the IPC is that under the first part, the crime of murder is first established and the accused is then given the benefit of one of the exceptions to Section 300 of the IPC, while under the second part, the crime of murder is never established at all.	Ratio
Therefore, for the purpose of holding an accused guilty of the offence punishable under the second part of Section 304 of the IPC, the accused need not bring his case within one of the exceptions to Section 300 of the IPC. (6) The word 'likely' means probably and it is distinguished from more 'possibly'. When chances of happening are even or greater than its not happening, we may say that the thing will 'probably happen'.	Ratio
In reaching the conclusion, the court has to place itself in the situation of the accused and then judge whether the accused had the knowledge that by the act he was likely to cause death. (7) The distinction between culpable homicide ( Section 299 of the IPC) and murder ( Section 300 of the IPC) has always to be carefully borne in mind while dealing with a charge under Section 302 of the IPC. Under the category of SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 50 of 54 unlawful homicides, both, the cases of culpable homicide amounting to murder and those not amounting to murder would fall.	Ratio
Culpable homicide is not murder when the case is brought within the five exceptions to Section 300 of the IPC. But, even though none of the said five exceptions are pleaded or prima facie established on the evidence on record, the prosecution must still be required under the law to bring the case under any of the four clauses of Section 300 of the IPC to sustain the charge of murder. If the prosecution fails to discharge this onus in establishing any one of the four clauses of Section 300 of the IPC, namely, 1stly to 4thly, the charge of murder would not be made out and the case may be one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder as described under Section 299 of the IPC. (8) The court must address itself to the question of mens rea.	Ratio
If Clause thirdly of Section 300 is to be applied, the assailant must intend the particular injury inflicted on the deceased. This ingredient could rarely be proved by direct evidence.	Ratio
Inevitably, it is a matter of inference to be drawn from the proved circumstances of the case. The court must necessarily have regard to the nature of the weapon used, part of the body injured, extent of the injury, degree of force used in causing the injury, the manner of attack, the circumstances preceding and attendant on the attack. (9) Intention to kill is not the only intention that makes a culpable homicide a murder.	Ratio
The intention to cause injury or injuries sufficient in the ordinary cause of nature to cause death also makes a culpable homicide a murder if death has actually been caused and intention to cause such injury or injuries is to be inferred from the act or acts resulting in the injury or injuries. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc. Page 51 of 54 (10) When single injury inflicted by the accused results in the death of the victim, no inference, as a general principle, can be drawn that the accused did not have the intention to cause the death or that particular injury which resulted in the death of the victim.	Ratio
Whether an accused had the required guilty intention or not, is a question of fact which has to be determined on the facts of each case. (11) Where the prosecution proves that the accused had the intention to cause death of any person or to cause bodily injury to him and the intended injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, then, even if he inflicts a single injury which results in the death of the victim, the offence squarely falls under Clause thirdly of Section 300 of the IPC unless one of the exceptions applies. (12) In determining the question, whether an accused had guilty intention or guilty knowledge in a case where only a single injury is inflicted by him and that injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the fact that the act is done without premeditation in a sudden fight or quarrel, or that the circumstances justify that the injury was accidental or unintentional, or that he only intended a simple injury, would lead to the inference of guilty knowledge, and the offence would be one under Section 304 Part II of the IPC ." 24. In the facts of case in hand, there appears to be no pre meditation or any common intention made at the spur of the moment by the accused persons to cause death of K.L. Sharma.	Ratio
The manner and specific role to each accused in the alleged physical assault has not been proved by the prosecution. There were no external injuries which were seen on the body of the SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.	FAC

If there was a physical assault, it is highly improbable that when allegedly about 03 accused persons were assaulting the deceased, he would not sustain any such injury. PW21 in his cross- examination has stated that "it is correct that no blood was found at the spot, when I went to the spot to prepare the site plan, hence no one could show me any wall or floor, where the scuffle could have taken place.......... I had visited the spot thrice, once at the time of incident and subsequently two more times. I had arrested accused Ravinder from his house on 13.07.2911 and had visited the spot at his instance.	FAC

The deceased died about 9-10 days after the incident.	FAC
There was no eye witness or any other independent public witness which have supported the case of the prosecution. No weapon of offence has been recovered.	ARG
There is no CCTV footage of the incident which has been proved by the prosecution. SC No. 58972/2016, FIR No. 333/2011, PS Prashant Vihar State Vs. Ravinder Kumar Etc.

Sharma in the wake of the tests and guidelines as laid by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the aforesaid case laws, discussed above. 26. In view of the aforesaid discussions and findings, benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused persons and accordingly accused persons namely Ravinder Kumar, Gulabo Devi and Geeta are acquitted against the charges levelled against them i.e. under Section 302 / 34 IPC, in the present case. 27. File be consigned to record room after due compliance. 28.
